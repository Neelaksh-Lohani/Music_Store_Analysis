1. Music Store Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a relational music store database to uncover meaningful business insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and music preferences.

Using SQL, the project explores key business questions such as identifying high-value customers, analyzing revenue trends, discovering top-performing artists, and understanding genre popularity across different regions.

The analysis simulates real-world business decision-making by transforming raw transactional data into actionable insights using advanced SQL techniques including joins, subqueries, aggregations, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions.

2. Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze music store sales data and extract business insights that can help improve customer targeting, marketing strategy, and revenue optimization.
